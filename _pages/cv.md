## Research Experience

### **LLM-based Agents: Desire-driven Autonomy**  
*Peking University, Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)*  
*Mar 2024 – Sept 2024*  
- Designed and developed Desire-driven Autonomy (D2A) to simulate human-like daily activities  
- Demonstrated that the Desire-driven autonomous agent significantly outperforms baseline agents in generating realistic activity sequences, as evaluated by GPT-4 and human annotators  
- Authored a paper based on this work, which is currently under submission  

### **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**  
*Peking University*  
*Oct 2024 – Present*  
- Designed a distributed LLMs fine-tuning framework, where model parameters along different directions are fine-tuned across multiple GPUs  
- Developed a synchronization mechanism to ensure consistency of aggregated model parameters across GPUs  

### **Large Language Models Reasoning**  
*Peking University*  
*Apr 2024 – Sept 2024*  
- Explored using LLMs to automatically label known information and prior reasoning steps, dynamically selecting useful information for the next inference step by modifying the attention mask  
- Achieved acceleration in inference stage but observed no significant improvement in reasoning accuracy  

### **Large Language Models Reasoning**  
*Peking University*  
*Sept 2023 – Feb 2024*  
- Contributed to the Chain of Images (CoI) approach, leveraging generated images to assist models in reasoning through complex textual problems  
- Constructed datasets across multiple domains, generated reasoning-supportive images, and fine-tuned models to improve performance on CoI evaluation tasks
