I am a junior undergraduate student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am a member of [GraphPKU](https://www.graphpku.cn) Lab, advised by Prof.[Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io). My research in [GraphPKU](https://www.graphpku.cn) focuses on enhancing the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) Reasoning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). I am also fortunate to do research in [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://eng.bigai.ai/), developing human-like social agents under the mentorship of Prof.[Fangwei Zhong](https://fangweizhong.xyz/). 

My research interests primarily focus on:
1.	Enhancing the capabilities of foundation models.
2.	Adapting foundation models more effectively to the field of agents, aiming to construct agents with general intelligence（eg. social interaction, adaptive decision-making, long-horizon planning).
